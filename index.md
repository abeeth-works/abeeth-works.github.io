I like tinkering with things. 

Taking things apart and putting them back together; got reprimanded
for doing that so many times as a kid you'd think I would have
grown out of it, but I haven't. 

I'm documenting my second foray into the world of programming here.
After how things worked out the last time; now I have a better idea
of steering the waters of 'self-taught', or so I like to think!
