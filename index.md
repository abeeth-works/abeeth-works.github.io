This will be more about documentation and learnings, and
less of a portfolio because well, it doesn't quite feel rght
to take sample projects that are completed during/for a course
and put them up on a portfolio now does it?

There will be dedicated sections once some of the more interesting projects
that I've set up for myself start to get interesting, right now,
they are more in an infant stage and need a lot more work and time to
be put into them before anyone would give them a second glance.
