Hello there - I am Abeeth. A self-proclaimed tech-enthusiast/to-be-code-junky re-visiting 
the programming realms after a decade long hiatus. I graduated from Humber College, Toronto 
as a computer programmer 
[(CPAN)](https://appliedtechnology.humber.ca/programs/computer-programming.html?) 
all the way back in 2011 - but ended up managing stock at a 
Walmart super-centre instead of managing bugs in code.

Retail taught me patience, and how to deal with people - especially when they are being 
insufferable. I learnt how to _almost_ keep a straight face and prod a conversation towards 
de-escalation without losing it - for the way I was before, this was a welcome change.

Few years later some gears shifted and I found myself back in tech, albeit as a writer. 
I had a very satisfying and productive stint and 
[Roar Media](https://roar.media/english/), Sri Lanka. I started out covering the startup/tech 
scene - eventually ended up heading the 
[Sinhala side of things](https://roar.media/sinhala/) for the platform. Sounds basic? 
Not even close. I can still remember how we started with 0 articles and 0 followers - by the time 
I stepped down we were at 1000+ articles from a massive team of freelance and full-time writers, 
and the readership was in hundreds of thousands with the Sinhala division raking in ad-revenue.

Following that - I did a full-circle and landed right back in web development. 
My content background got me into the marketing department of CISI-UK as a 
front-end developer. For a couple years, HTML/CSS/JS was my bread and butter along with 
Bootstrap. We built some cool stuff there - 
[this is my favourite out of the lot](https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/study-with-us/qualifications-navigato).

_And that, marks the end of the good-times._

There's no point regurgitating the string of unfortunate gigs that I've landed since; 
some featured psycho bosses who paid well and on time but treated everyone like trash, 
and some had perpetually pacifying snobs at the helm who stay afloat by desperately clinging 
to every new catch-phrase and hot-topic out in the open. It's been bad but I've learnt 
a lot.

That brings me to the present: I have learnt the hard way that there is no point in pursuing 
someone else's dreams when said people lack a vision or the ability to listen. Dreams change. 
People change. 

>And when those changes happen at the expense of your well-being or 
that of those around you who you care about, lines need to be drawn.

I'm back on track teaching myself programming - I plan to get a full-time coding gig within 
this year, while setting myself up for success with some high-quality documenting of my
programming journey.

Godspeed!
